# Flask ML Server with Celery Integration

This project aims to build a Flask server that handles requests from the Poldit Front End for text classification and question/answering using machine learning models and large language models like OpenAI. It utilizes Celery with CloudAMQP as a queue system to offload the AI analysis tasks to Celery workers. The responses generated by the workers are then sent to the Poldit API, which is a Node.js backend using GraphQL.

## Features

- Flask server to handle requests for text classification and question/answering.
- Integration with machine learning models and large language models like OpenAI.
- Celery integration for task queueing and distributed processing.
- Use of CloudAMQP as the message broker for Celery.
- Interaction with the Poldit API, a Node.js backend using GraphQL.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Celery
- CloudAMQP
- Machine learning models and large language models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3)

## Installation
